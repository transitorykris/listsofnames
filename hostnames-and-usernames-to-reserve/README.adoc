= Hostnames and usernames to reserve

If you're developing or installing a service with accounts,
this is a list of hostnames and usernames that you should deny.

All the credit goes to Geoffrey Thomas who also gives a good explanation of
why you should adopt such list in his blog post:
https://ldpreload.com/blog/names-to-reserve
Please make sure to read that to understand that this blacklist is only one part of the protection needed to avoid issues like domain-level cookies.

If you see any omission in the list, send me a https://github.com/zimbatm/hostnames-and-usernames-to-reserve/pulls[PR].

== The username format

For the sake of forward-compatiblity (and keeping the blacklist small), all usernames should only allow ASCII-only hostname-like names.

In regexp format: `/^[a-z]([a-z0-9-]*[a-z0-9])?$/`

== The list file format

Each line is either an empty line, a comment or a username.

A comment line starts with a # character.

Usernames can also be duplicated if they belong to different categories.

Or if you want to import the list programmatically here is the
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Backus%E2%80%93Naur_Form[EBNF] format:

[source,ebnf]
----
cr = "\n";
not-cr = all characters - cr;

comment = "#", { not-cr } ;
username = all characters - "#" , { not-cr } ;

line = ( comment | username | ), cr ;

grammar = { line } ;
